Activity: Forms 3/3: Add a profile image

Take your application from the previous exercise, "Validate a form." Add a field for a profile image. This image can be a .png, .jpg, or .gif file.

Save the uploaded image in public/uploads and display it on the next page after the form is submitted, along with all other information as it did previously.
